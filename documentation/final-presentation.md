# Problem

## Knowledge Management Crisis

- 19% of time spent searching information
- Exponential data growth
- Siloed knowledge
- Currency challenges

::: notes
Today we're addressing a critical challenge in organizational knowledge management. Studies show employees spend nearly one-fifth of their time just searching for information. This isn't just inefficient - it's a symptom of deeper problems in how we manage organizational knowledge.

The challenge is threefold: First, information is growing exponentially. Second, knowledge is trapped in departmental silos. Third, keeping information current in rapidly evolving fields is nearly impossible with traditional approaches.

# Solution

## The Chelle Knowledge Model

- Automated knowledge extraction
- Context-aware processing
- Human-in-the-loop validation
- Mathematical formalism

::: notes
The Chelle Knowledge Model, or CKM, represents a fundamental shift in knowledge management. Instead of relying on manual curation, we're leveraging Large Language Models for automated knowledge extraction and organization.

What makes CKM unique is its mathematical foundation. Every relationship between concepts is formally defined and computationally verifiable. This isn't just a database - it's a living knowledge structure that evolves with your organization.

# Implementation

## Architecture

- Docker + Microservices
- FastAPI + Redis Queue
- MongoDB storage
- Next.js frontend
- LLM integration

::: notes
Let's look at how we built this in practice. The implementation uses a modern, scalable architecture built on containerized microservices. Each component is independently scalable - we're running 20 API replicas and 4 worker nodes in our current setup.

The core components are:

- FastAPI for our backend services
- Redis Queue for distributed task management
- MongoDB for flexible document storage
- Next.js for a responsive frontend
- LLM integration through structured prompts

## Processing Pipeline

![The Knowledge Processing Pipeline](documentation/lf-asset-processing-trace.png)

::: notes
This diagram shows our knowledge processing pipeline in action. Documents enter the system and go through multiple stages:

1. Classification and metadata extraction
2. Lexeme identification
3. Citation processing
4. Concept formation

Each stage is monitored through Langfuse, giving us visibility into the LLM operations and helping identify bottlenecks.

# Challenges

## Technical Hurdles

- Asynchronous processing
- Worker load balancing
- Debug complexity
- Scaling issues

::: notes
Building this system revealed several key challenges. The most significant was managing asynchronous processing at scale. When processing documents with many concepts, our initial approach to load balancing proved insufficient.

We also discovered that debugging asynchronous operations in an LLM pipeline requires specialized tooling. This led us to implement comprehensive trace logging and monitoring - a silver lining that improved our overall system observability.

# Results

## Current Status

- Core functionality proven viable
- Engineering-focused challenges
- Promising initial results
- Foundation for scaling

::: notes
The proof-of-concept implementation has validated our core architectural decisions. While we faced scaling challenges, these proved to be engineering problems rather than fundamental limitations of the approach.

The system successfully demonstrates automated knowledge extraction and organization, though some advanced features remain theoretical. Importantly, our initial results suggest that LLM-based knowledge management can be both practical and scalable.

# Future

## Next Steps

- Complete relationship extraction
- Implement validation system
- Optimize worker performance
- Expand monitoring capabilities

::: notes
Looking ahead, our focus is on four key areas:

1. Completing the relationship extraction system to capture complex knowledge connections
2. Implementing our human-in-the-loop validation framework
3. Optimizing worker performance for large-scale processing
4. Expanding our monitoring capabilities through Langfuse

The ultimate goal is to make ontology creation as accessible as database management, enabling new approaches to organizational knowledge management.

Remember to pause for questions after each major section, particularly after the architecture and challenges sections where technical audience members often have specific implementation questions.

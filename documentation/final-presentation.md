# Problem

## Knowledge Management Crisis

- 19% of time spent searching information (Chui et al., 2012)
- Exponential data growth (Taylor, 2023)
- Departmental silos impair decision-making (Deloitte, 2020)
- Currency challenges in rapidly evolving fields (Tamayo et al., 2023)

::: notes
Organizations face substantial challenges in managing institutional knowledge. Studies show employees spend nearly one-fifth of their time searching for information. This represents both operational and productivity costs.

The challenge is multifaceted:
1. Information volume growing exponentially
2. Knowledge trapped in departmental silos
3. Maintaining currency in rapidly evolving fields
4. Traditional approaches showing decreasing effectiveness with scale

# Solution

## The Chelle Knowledge Model (CKM)

![](documentation/knowledge-model.png)

## The Chelle Knowledge Model (CKM)

- Three-layer architecture:
  1. Conceptual Layer
  2. Relationship Layer
  3. Operational Layer
- Mathematical formalism
- Human-in-the-loop validation
- Automated knowledge extraction

::: notes
The Chelle Knowledge Model (CKM) represents a fundamental shift in knowledge management. It's built on a three-layer architecture that provides a complete framework for knowledge organization.

Key innovations:
- Conceptual Layer handles lexeme identification and concept formation
- Relationship Layer manages formal knowledge connections
- Operational Layer transforms abstract concepts into concrete implementations

Each layer maintains strict mathematical formalism while preserving semantic relationships.

## Core Operations

Three fundamental knowledge processing operations:

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}

1. Entity extraction
2. Relationship extraction
3. Ontological mapping
:::
::: {.column width="60%"}

:::
::::::::::::::

::: notes
The CKM implements three core operations essential for effective organizational knowledge management:

1. Entity extraction identifies and classifies knowledge components
2. Relationship extraction discovers and formalizes connections
3. Ontological mapping creates structured knowledge hierarchies

These operations work together to create a complete knowledge processing pipeline.

::: notes
The implementation uses a modern, scalable architecture:

- Docker containers for modular deployment
- FastAPI for RESTful endpoints
- Redis Queue for distributed processing
- MongoDB for flexible document storage
- Next.js for responsive frontend
- AWS Bedrock for LLM integration
- Langfuse for comprehensive monitoring

Currently running 20 API replicas and 4 worker nodes.

::: notes
The knowledge processing pipeline consists of four main stages:

1. Document Classification and Metadata Extraction
   - Domain-specific prompts
   - Multiple document categories
   
2. Lexeme Extraction
   - General-purpose and domain-specific extractors
   - Structured prompt repository

3. Citation Processing
   - Supporting evidence extraction
   - Scalability considerations

4. Concept Formation
   - Synthesis of lexemes and citations
   - JSON-based prompt structure

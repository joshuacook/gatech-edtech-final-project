# I. Introduction

Organizations face significant challenges in managing their institutional knowledge. Studies show that employees spend 19% of their time searching for and gathering information (Chui et al., 2012), while knowledge silos impair organizational decision-making processes (Deloitte, 2020). The volume of organizational data continues to grow exponentially (Taylor, 2023; Gartner, 2023), with information scattered across departments, systems, versions, and documents (Deloitte, 2020). These inefficiencies represent both operational and productivity costs.

The knowledge management challenge encompasses several key dimensions. First, organizations must maintain knowledge currency in rapidly evolving fields (Tamayo et al., 2023). Second, they must address departmental silos that prevent effective knowledge sharing (Cross et al., 2004). Third, they must ensure consistent knowledge access across their workforce while managing domain-specific vocabulary and concepts (Otero et al., 2015). Traditional knowledge management approaches, based on manual curation and hierarchical structures, have limitations in addressing these needs (AIIM, 2023). Research indicates that knowledge management effectiveness decreases as organizational complexity increases, with larger enterprises reporting lower satisfaction rates with their systems (Heisig et al., 2016).

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents new opportunities for addressing these organizational knowledge management challenges. Recent research demonstrates that LLMs can significantly enhance knowledge extraction and ontology development processes (Babaei Giglou et al., 2023). However, effective implementation requires addressing several technical challenges, including context limitations and potential hallucination issues (Bikeyev, 2023; Wang et al., 2023).

This paper presents the Chelle Knowledge Model (CKM), a novel approach to organizational knowledge management that leverages LLMs for automated knowledge extraction and organization, along with a proof-of-concept implementation demonstrating its practical application. The CKM specifically addresses the challenges of knowledge currency, accessibility, and scalability through a structured approach to knowledge processing and organization.

The CKM framework integrates three core components for knowledge processing: entity extraction, relation extraction, and ontology mapping. This approach builds on recent advances in zero-shot learning for knowledge base population (Caufield et al., 2024) and entity mapping (Matentzoglu et al., 2023). The system employs a human-in-the-loop validation approach to ensure accuracy and build trust in automated knowledge extraction processes.

The core architecture of CKM comprises:

1. A Knowledge Extractor Application that processes unstructured textual data
2. Document Processing Models that handle entity extraction, relation extraction, and ontology mapping
3. An integration layer that connects these components while maintaining semantic consistency
4. A validation framework that ensures extracted knowledge accuracy

This approach differs from traditional knowledge management systems in several key aspects. First, it employs zero-shot information extraction techniques (Wei et al., 2024) to reduce manual curation requirements. Second, it maintains explicit context tracking and versioning to preserve semantic integrity across different organizational contexts. Third, it implements formal relationship modeling that allows for flexible knowledge evolution while maintaining consistency. The accompanying proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates the practical feasibility of these concepts.

### Contributions

The contributions of this work include:

1. A novel framework for structuring LLM interactions in knowledge management that specifically addresses organizational challenges. The CKM approach demonstrates how LLMs can be effectively integrated into existing knowledge management processes while maintaining semantic consistency and supporting natural knowledge evolution (Matentzoglu et al., 2023).

2. A proof-of-concept implementation that validates the feasibility of automated knowledge extraction and organization using LLMs. The implementation demonstrates practical solutions to challenges in scaling LLM-based knowledge processing systems, particularly in handling complex document processing workloads and managing worker load balancing.

3. Practical insights into the challenges and solutions for LLM-based knowledge processing in organizational contexts. While existing research has focused on theoretical approaches to knowledge extraction (Caufield et al., 2024), this work provides concrete implementation strategies and identifies specific engineering considerations for deploying such systems at scale.

4. A framework for context-aware knowledge extraction that preserves semantic relationships across different organizational contexts. This extends current approaches to ontology learning (Babaei Giglou et al., 2023) by incorporating explicit context management and relationship modeling.

5. Architectural patterns for building scalable knowledge processing systems that integrate LLMs with traditional knowledge management approaches. These patterns address practical concerns such as worker load balancing, API management, and system scalability while maintaining semantic consistency in knowledge extraction and organization.

The research and implementation demonstrate that while significant technical challenges exist in scaling LLM-based knowledge management systems, these challenges are primarily engineering problems rather than fundamental limitations of the approach. The successful implementation of core functionality supports the viability of using LLMs to transform organizational knowledge management through automated extraction and organization processes.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the Chelle Knowledge Model (CKM) in detail, including its design principles and core components. Section III describes the knowledge processing pipeline implementation and technical architecture. Section V discusses implementation progress, challenges, and implications for future work. Finally, Section VI concludes with an analysis of the transformative potential of automated ontology creation in organizational knowledge management.

# II. The Chelle Knowledge Model (CKM)

### Overview and Motivation

Traditional knowledge bases often fail to effectively manage and preserve context, leading to significant inefficiencies in knowledge extraction and application. According to AIIM (2023), 74% of organizational content systems remain disconnected from other business systems, creating persistent knowledge silos. The rapid growth of scientific and technical literature further compounds these challenges, outpacing traditional manual curation efforts (Caufield et al., 2024).

The Chelle Knowledge Model addresses these limitations through a structured approach to knowledge organization and processing. The model recognizes that knowledge meaning and relationships evolve with context, necessitating a formal framework for preserving semantic integrity while supporting natural knowledge evolution.

### Design Principles

The Chelle Knowledge Model (CKM) is founded on five fundamental design principles:

1. **Semantic Integrity and Context Preservation**

- Explicit context tracking across all knowledge transformations
- Version control for all knowledge elements
- Provenance tracking from raw assets through refined knowledge
- Preservation of semantic relationships across organizational contexts

2. **Mathematical Formalism**

- Complete lattice structure for relationship hierarchies
- Formal relationship classification system with precise mathematical semantics
- Computationally verifiable constraints and validations
- Rigorous dependency management through directed acyclic graphs

3. **Operational Transparency**

- Bidirectional traceability between conceptual and operational elements
- Explicit validation requirements at every transformation step
- Complete audit trails for all knowledge operations
- Clear separation between raw assets and refined knowledge

4. **Knowledge Evolution Management**

- Structured approaches for handling concept relationships over time
- Formal procedures for relationship validation and strength calculations
- Systematic mapping validation across knowledge domains
- Clear versioning and inheritance rules for knowledge structures

5. **Human-in-the-Loop Validation**

- Explicit roles for knowledge curation and oversight
- Authority designation for knowledge validation
- Systematic quality checks with human verification
- Clear certification processes for knowledge understanding

### Core Components

The CKM implements its design principles through three integrated layers:

1. Knowledge Foundation Layer

- Knowledge Representation: Manages raw assets, refined knowledge, and their relationships
- Semantic Layer: Implements the complete relationship lattice and validation framework
- Context Management: Handles organizational context, versioning, and knowledge evolution

2. Operational Layer

- Implementation Framework: Transforms abstract concepts into concrete operational elements
- Validation System: Ensures consistency between conceptual and operational components
- Tools & Templates: Standardized patterns for knowledge implementation

3. Instruction Layer

- Assessment Framework: Measures and validates understanding levels
- Role Management: Handles mentor/learner interactions and authority designation
- Learning Structure: Organizes knowledge into guides and learning paths

Each layer maintains bidirectional traceability and implements the model's mathematical formalism through computably verifiable constraints and validations.

### Implementation Considerations

#### Theoretical Requirements

The theoretical framework of CKM translates into specific technical requirements across three key areas: document processing, storage architecture, and integration requirements. Document processing encompasses context-aware lexeme identification, relationship detection within and across contexts, and validation against formal CKM rules. The storage architecture demands context-preserving schema design, efficient indexing for context-based retrieval, version control implementation, and change tracking across contexts.

Integration requirements focus on four critical aspects:

- API design for LLM interaction
- Worker load balancing for scalable processing
- Cache management for efficient retrieval
- Human-in-the-loop validation interfaces

These theoretical considerations guided our architectural decisions in the proof-of-concept implementation described below.

#### Proof-of-Concept Implementation

The proof-of-concept implementation of CKM was built as a containerized microservices architecture, with the following key technical decisions:

1. Infrastructure Design

   - Docker-based containerization for all services
   - NGINX reverse proxy for load balancing and routing
   - Redis for queue management and caching
   - MongoDB for persistent storage
   - Scalable API instances (20 replicas) and worker nodes (4 replicas)

2. Backend Architecture

   - FastAPI framework for RESTful API endpoints
   - Python RQ (Redis Queue) for distributed task processing
   - Langfuse for LLM operation monitoring
   - Resource management with container-level CPU/memory limits
   - WebSocket support for real-time updates

3. Frontend Implementation

   - Next.js framework replacing initial Streamlit interface
   - React components for interactive knowledge visualization
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket connections
   - Static asset optimization through NGINX

4. Development Environment

   - Jupyter Lab integration for interactive development
   - RQ Dashboard for queue visualization
   - Hot-reload capability for rapid iteration
   - Comprehensive Python package management
   - Automated setup and fixture loading

5. Integration Patterns
   - AWS Bedrock for Claude API access
   - Structured prompts for knowledge extraction
   - Context-aware processing pipeline
   - Human-in-the-loop validation interfaces

The implementation directly addresses the theoretical requirements through several key architectural decisions:

1. Document Processing Requirements

   - Context-aware lexeme identification implemented via specialized processor classes
   - Relationship detection handled through structured prompts and validation chains
   - CKM rule validation enforced through typed model constraints
   - Processing state tracking via MongoDB document versioning

2. Storage Architecture Requirements

   - Context preservation achieved through metadata enrichment and version control
   - Efficient retrieval enabled by MongoDB indexing on context fields
   - Change tracking implemented via event sourcing pattern
   - Version control managed through immutable document patterns

3. Integration Requirements
   - LLM interaction managed through structured prompt templates and validation chains
   - Worker load balancing achieved via Redis Queue with 4 worker nodes
   - Human validation interfaces built into the Next.js frontend components

This architecture demonstrates that the theoretical CKM framework can be practically implemented, though scaling challenges remain around concurrent processing and validation chain performance.

# III. Implementation of the Knowledge Processing Pipeline

The proof-of-concept implementation focused on establishing core functionality for automated knowledge extraction and concept formation using Large Language Models. The current implementation demonstrates basic pipeline functionality while revealing important technical challenges that inform future development.

### Architecture Overview

The system implementation follows a processor-based architecture, with distinct components handling specific aspects of document analysis and knowledge extraction. The core processors are organized in a hierarchical structure:

```
api/processors/assets/
- process_citations.py
- process_definitions.py
- process_images.py
- process_lexemes.py
- process_refined.py
- process_refined_metadata.py
- process_refined_splitting.py
- process_tables.py
```

Each processor implements a specific stage in the knowledge extraction pipeline, with processing flows managed through an asynchronous task system.

### Document Processing Pipeline

The current implementation successfully demonstrates several key components:

#### Document Classification and Metadata Extraction

The system employs domain-specific prompts to analyze incoming documents, classifying them into categories including Technical, Educational/Academic, Commercial/Business, Legal/Compliance, Research/Scientific, Administrative/Operational, and General/Mixed. This classification determines subsequent processing strategies.

#### Lexeme Extraction

The system implements both general-purpose and domain-specific lexeme extraction. Domain-specific extractors use carefully crafted prompts targeting particular document types. For example, academic document processing focuses on identifying learning components, pedagogical elements, and domain-specific terminology. These prompts are organized in a structured repository:

```
prompts/assets/lexeme/
- academic.txt
- administrative.txt
- business.txt
- general.txt
- legal.txt
- research.txt
- technical.txt
```

#### Citation Processing

For each identified lexeme, the system extracts supporting citations from the source document. This component currently processes lexemes sequentially, which has revealed significant scalability challenges when handling documents with high lexeme density (>25 lexemes).

#### Concept Formation

The system synthesizes lexemes and their supporting citations into structured concept definitions using a JSON-based prompt structure. This ensures consistent concept representation while maintaining traceability between concepts and their supporting evidence.

### Technical Challenges and Solutions

Several significant technical challenges emerged during implementation:

1. **Asynchronous Processing**: The system's initial design revealed limitations in handling multiple concurrent lexeme processing tasks. Integration of Langfuse monitoring provided crucial insights into processing bottlenecks and component interaction patterns.

2. **Worker Load Balancing**: Initial attempts to address performance issues through API server load balancing proved insufficient. Subsequent implementation of worker-level load balancing demonstrated more promising results, though requiring substantial architectural refactoring.

3. **Debug Complexity**: The asynchronous nature of the processing pipeline complicated debugging efforts, particularly for delayed processing functions. This challenge led to the implementation of comprehensive trace logging and monitoring.

### Monitoring and Observability

The integration of Langfuse provided essential observability into the LLM-based processing pipeline. The monitoring system tracks:

- Processing duration for each pipeline stage
- Success/failure rates for processing tasks
- Resource utilization patterns
- Component interaction sequences

This monitoring infrastructure has proved invaluable for both development iteration and system optimization.

### Current State and Limitations

The current implementation successfully demonstrates core functionality while revealing important insights about scaling LLM-based knowledge processing systems. Key limitations include:

- Sequential processing constraints for citation extraction
- Processing time scaling issues with complex documents
- Debug complexity in asynchronous operations

These limitations, while significant, represent engineering challenges rather than fundamental conceptual flaws in the approach.

# IV. Discussion

The implementation of the knowledge processing pipeline demonstrated both promising results and revealed important technical challenges that impact system scalability. While core functionality was successfully implemented and performed well, several key insights emerged during development.

### Implementation Progress and Challenges

The core system functionality was successfully implemented and demonstrated effective performance. However, a significant scalability challenge emerged when processing rich documents containing numerous concepts (>25 lexemes), leading to performance degradation. This bottleneck led to exploring two distinct solution paths:

1. Initial attempts focused on load balancing the API server to better utilize system resources
2. Subsequently, attention shifted to worker load balancing, which proved to be the correct approach but required substantial code refactoring

Notably, the troubleshooting process led to the discovery and integration of Langfuse, a monitoring and observability solution for LLM applications. This addition to the technology stack emerged as a silver lining of the scalability challenges, providing valuable insights into LLM operation and performance that will benefit future development iterations.

### Scope Management Insights

A key learning from this implementation process was the importance of careful scope management in research projects. While the theoretical framework of the CKM was well-developed and remains sound, the implementation would have benefited from a more targeted initial approach focusing on:

1. Small, representative document samples rather than full-scale processing
2. Core functionality demonstration over scalability optimization
3. Complete implementation of basic features before addressing performance challenges

This experience provides valuable insight for similar projects in the field: when implementing complex theoretical frameworks, starting with minimal viable examples can provide faster validation of core concepts while avoiding premature optimization challenges. The integration of Langfuse during troubleshooting demonstrates how technical challenges can lead to unexpected improvements in system architecture.

### Preliminary Results

Initial results from concept extraction and definition were promising, based on ad hoc analysis of system logs. The LLM-based approach demonstrated effectiveness in identifying and defining concepts from input documents. However, it should be noted that due to development focusing on core functionality, the system's output capture mechanisms were not implemented in a way that would support rigorous research validation and presentation.

### Time Constraints and Future Work

The primary limiting factor in this implementation was time rather than fundamental issues with the system architecture or approach. The underlying architectural decisions appear sound based on the implemented components' performance. Development of the system will continue, with particular focus on:

1. Completing the relationship extraction functionality
2. Implementing robust output capture for proper evaluation
3. Leveraging the refactored worker load balancing system for improved scalability
4. Expanding the use of Langfuse for monitoring and optimization of LLM interactions

Manual experiments with knowledge model construction and LLM interaction have provided encouraging indicators of the system's potential effectiveness, though formal validation remains to be completed. The successful implementation of core functionality, despite scalability challenges, supports the viability of the overall architectural approach. Future work will build upon these foundations to realize the full potential of the system.

# V. Conclusion

## Transformative Potential of Automated Ontology Creation

The most significant insight from this research is not merely the automation of ontology creation through LLMs, but rather how this automation fundamentally transforms the role of ontologies in knowledge management. When ontology creation shifts from a months-long expert endeavor to a rapid, iterative process, it enables ontologies to be deployed for previously impractical use cases - much like how the accessibility of databases or notebooks has enabled their widespread adoption in diverse contexts.

## Implementation Insights

While the proof-of-concept implementation faced expected challenges in scaling complex machine learning systems, these challenges proved to be primarily engineering hurdles rather than fundamental limitations. The core functionality demonstrated the viability of the architectural approach, particularly in concept extraction and definition, though full relationship extraction capabilities remain to be implemented.

The development of the Chelle Knowledge Model (CKM) emerged as a foundational framework - akin to a constitutional document - providing guiding principles for knowledge management implementation. This theoretical foundation, combined with consistently promising outputs from experimental work, suggests strong potential for the overall approach.

### Practical Applications

The immediate practical application of this work focuses on educational contexts, specifically facilitating connections between students, teachers, and knowledge resources. This narrow but concrete focus provides a clear path for validating the approach while avoiding overextension of the system's capabilities.

### Future Work

Two critical areas require attention for advancing this work:

1. Development of a complete working system implementation that demonstrates the full potential of the theoretical framework
2. Rigorous validation of the system's effectiveness in real-world applications

The successful implementation of core functionality, despite various technical challenges, supports the fundamental viability of using LLMs to transform knowledge management through rapid ontology creation and deployment. While significant work remains, particularly in validation and scaling, the potential to fundamentally change how organizations approach knowledge structuring and management appears promising.

## Chelle Knowledge Model

### Purpose

Chelle manages an organization’s information via construction of a knowledge model (KM) for that organization.

A KM is used for:

- Encoding an organization’s knowledge (concepts, definitions, facts, relationships)
- Organizing an organization’s documents (documents are tagged by concept)

### Document Conventions

In this document, the following conventions apply, which should help in navigating:

- The sub-headings are the terms contained in the Glossary, and the content within is the complete definition of the term, followed by the facts we know about the term.
- When a definition or fact makes reference to another term in the Glossary, the term is _italicized_. A term is **bolded** in its own definition.
  - Example: ‘**Understanding** is a degree of demonstrated retention of a _Concept_.’ Concept is italicized here because it is a term belonging to the Glossary. Understanding is bolded because this is its own definition.
- When a definition makes use of customized language in defining a property of the term, the customized language is put in “quotes”. For example, if a term from the Glossary defines an entity which has a property that may only contain certain values, and those values are enumerated, they would be quoted. Customized language from the definition of one term may appear in the definition of another term.
  - An example of this can be found in the _Concept_ term, where we use the word “lexeme”. That word is a child of the term _Concept_, so it’s not big enough to be its own term in the Glossary, but it may need to be referenced elsewhere, so the quotes help identify it.

### Core Principles

#### Dependency Ordering

A term $T_1$ must be defined before term $T_2$ if and only if $T_2$'s definition contains $T_1$. This creates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of definitional dependencies.

#### Term Structure

Each term entry consists of two parts:

- Definition: A precise statement that uniquely identifies the term using only previously defined terms
- Citations: Verified statements about the term that document its properties, behaviors, and relationships

#### Completeness Rule

The glossary $G$ is complete if and only if:

- Every term used in any definition is itself defined earlier in G
- Every term has exactly one definition
- No definition creates a circular dependency
- Every citation has a verifiable source

#### Relationship Uniqueness Rule

The system maintains exactly one explicit relationship between any pair of Concepts:

Every pair of Concepts $(A,B)$ must have exactly one Relationship Type $R$

Relationship Types are mutually exclusive

No implicit or derived relationships are stored

### Mathematical Foundations

#### Lattice Operations

The relationship hierarchy forms a complete lattice with the following operations:

##### Join Operation ($\cup$)

Definition: For any two relationship types $R_1$ and $R_2$, their join $R_1 \cup R_2$ is the least upper bound that satisfies both relationships

Formally: $R_1 \cup R_2 = \min\{R | R \geq R_1 \text{ and } R \geq R_2\}$

##### Meet Operation ($\cap$)

Definition: For any two relationship types $R_1$ and $R_2$, their meet $R_1 \cap R_2$ is the greatest lower bound that is satisfied by both relationships

Formally: $R_1 \cap R_2 = \max\{R | R \leq R_1 \text{ and } R \leq R_2\}$

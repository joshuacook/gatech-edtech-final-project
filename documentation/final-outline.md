# Title: Augmented Knowledge Base Creation and Curation using Large Language Models: A Proof-of-Concept Implementation

## I. Introduction

### General Problem Statement.

- Organizations struggle to efficiently extract, organize, and utilize knowledge from their unstructured textual data. This challenge encompasses:
  - Information Overload
    - the volume of documents and data within organizations is growing exponentially. (Taylor, P, 2023, Gartner, 2023)
  - Knowledge Silos
    - important information is often scattered across different departments, systems, versions, documents (Deloitte, 2020)
  - Manual Curation
    - traditional methods of knowledge organization rely heavily on manual effort (Chui, M. et al., 2012)
  - Lack of Standardization
    - challenging to integrate information from diverse sources (AIIM, 2023)
  - Rapid Obsolescence
    - knowledge can quickly become outdated, requiring constant updates (Tamayo, et al., 2023)
  - Domain Specificity
    - each organization or industry has its own specialized vocabulary and concepts solutions (Otero, et al., 2015)
  - Accessibility
    - even when knowledge is properly organized, it may not be easily accessible (Cross, et al., 2004)
  - Scalability
    - knowledge management systems often struggle to keep pace with growth (Heisig, et al., 2016)

### Background on LLMs and Knowledge Management

- Evolution and challenges of knowledge management systems
  - Historical reliance on manual curation
    - From Assignment 1: "Manual curation has been expensive and time-consuming. According to Karp (2016), the high costs associated with manual curation of knowledge bases make alternative strategies necessary, though these may result in lower quality knowledge."
  - Growing inefficiencies in traditional approaches
    - From Assignment 3: "Workers spend 19% of their time searching for and gathering information" (Chui et al., 2012)
    - "55% of organizations report that knowledge silos are a significant barrier to effective decision-making" (Deloitte, 2020)
  - Scale and complexity challenges
    - From Assignment 3: "A study of 179 multinational corporations found that as organizations grew in size and complexity, the effectiveness of their knowledge management systems decreased. Specifically, companies with over 10,000 employees reported a 23% lower satisfaction rate with their knowledge management systems compared to smaller firms" (Heisig et al., 2016)
- Emergence of LLMs as powerful text processing tools
  - From Assignment 2: "Pre-LLM era research predominantly pointed towards transformer-based BERT models for knowledge extraction tasks. What I'm seeing in this research is that the future lies in leveraging existing LLMs, especially those provided by major providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google."

- Current approaches to LLM-based knowledge extraction
  - From Assignment 1: "The integration of large language models (LLMs) into natural language processing techniques has revolutionized knowledge extraction and ontology development."
  - Can cite: Babaei Giglou et al. (2023) "LLMs4OL: Large language models for ontology learning"
  - Can cite: Wan et al. (2023) regarding in-context learning for relation extraction
- Challenges in leveraging LLMs effectively
  - From Assignment 3: "The challenge lies in developing efficient, accurate, and scalable methods to extract knowledge from diverse document sources, map this knowledge to existing ontologies, and present it in a form that is useful for non-expert users."

## II. The Chelle Knowledge Model (CKM)

### Overview and Motivation

- Traditional knowledge bases lack context management
- Knowledge meaning and relationships evolve with context
- Need for formal framework to preserve semantic integrity
- LLMs demonstrate context-sensitivity but require structure

### Comparison with Existing Approaches

Traditional RAG: Document retrieval and LLM synthesis
Direct KM-LLM Interface: Pre-constructed knowledge model interaction
Key differentiators in architecture and capabilities

### Design Principles

- Explicit context tracking and versioning
- Preservation of core concept definitions
- Formal relationship modeling across contexts
- Computationally verifiable validation
- Bidirectional traceability

### Core Components

1. Knowledge Representation

   - Base definitions independent of context
   - Context-specific extensions and relationships
   - Validation rules for semantic consistency
   - Version control for knowledge evolution

2. Context Framework

   - Explicit context declaration
   - Context hierarchy and inheritance
   - Relationship preservation across contexts
   - Context-specific validation rules

3. Integration Layer
   - LLM interaction patterns
   - Context injection methods
   - Response validation frameworks
   - Knowledge extraction rules

### Case Study: "Basis" in Linear Algebra

Demonstrates how CKM manages evolving concept understanding:

1. Base Definition:

   - Mathematical definition: linearly independent vectors spanning vector space
   - Core properties: independence, spanning, uniqueness

2. Context Evolution:

   - Week 5: Building intuition via random vectors
   - Week 7: Application to Central Limit Theorem
   - Context inheritance: maintains core definition while adding domain relevance

3. Validation Mechanisms:
   - Core property preservation
   - Context-specific relationship validation
   - Dependency tracking across context changes

This case study shows CKM's ability to:

- Maintain semantic consistency
- Support natural knowledge evolution
- Preserve relationships across contexts
- Guide LLM interactions systematically

### Video Script: Milestone 1 Demo

INTRODUCTION
"Welcome to the first milestone demo of our Knowledge Base Creation and Curation system. This project uses state of the art knowledge extraction and curation techniques to automate knowledge extraction and organization using the Chelle Ubiquitous Language as its foundation. Let me show you what we've built so far."

SYSTEM OVERVIEW
[Show Home Dashboard]
"The system is built around three core components:

- Concepts Management for defining and organizing knowledge
- Relationships Management for connecting concepts
- Operational Elements for practical implementation
  These directly mirror the layers defined in our Ubiquitous Language."

CONCEPTS DEMO
[Navigate to Concepts page]
"Here's our Concepts Management interface. We can create new concepts, which will eventually be populated through our LLM prompts. The current build demonstrates how we maintain the core structure defined in the CUL - each concept has a definition and associated citations."

RELATIONSHIPS DEMO
[Show Relationships visualization]
"Our relationship visualization shows how concepts are connected. While our prompting system for automatically identifying these relationships is still in development, the infrastructure for managing them is in place."

CONCLUSION
"This milestone focused on building the foundational architecture and initial prompting strategy. We've implemented the basic concept extraction prompts and built a system that can grow to support the full CUL structure. Next steps will focus on expanding our prompting capabilities and implementing the relationship layer."
